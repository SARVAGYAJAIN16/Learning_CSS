                    1. Link (`a:link`): This is the default state for an unvisited link. 

                    2. Visited (`a:visited`): This state applies to a link that the user has already visited. 

                    3. Hover (`a:hover`): This state triggers when the user hovers their mouse pointer over a link. 

                    4. Active (`a:active`): This state is triggered when the user clicks on a link. 

                     LVHA: This acronym represents the order of link states.
