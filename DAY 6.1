Understand about Overflow element in CSS.
    The overflow property in CSS is used to control how content overflows its containing element when it doesn't fit within the available space.
    It's a useful property for handling content that exceeds its container's dimensions. 
               It have 4 property:
                 1 -> overflow: visible (by default)
                      Overflow: Visible (Default): This is the default behavior where content can overflow its container without any clipping.
                      Use it when you want content to extend beyond its container's boundaries.  
                 2 -> overflow: hidden
                       Content that overflows the container is hidden and not visible. 
                       Useful when you want to hide extra content that doesn't fit within a fixed-size 
                 3 -> overflow : scroll
                       Scrollbars (both horizontal and vertical) are added to the container, allowing users to scroll to see the hidden content. 
                       Use it when you want to display all content and provide a scrolling mechanism. 
                 4 -> overflow : auto
                       Scrollbars are added only when content overflows the container. 
                       It's a combination of visible (no scrollbars if content fits) and scroll (scrollbars when content overflows).
                       Ideal for creating scrollable containers only when needed.
