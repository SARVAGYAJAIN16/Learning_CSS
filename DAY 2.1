               1 Absolute lengths(means it is fixed)
               Absolute Lengths:  The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

                 1.2 Inches(in)

                  2.1 em
                  2.2 root em (rem)         ***
                     Define:->  rem is also a relative unit like em, but it's based on the font size of the root (html) element.
                                Using rem ensures that the size is consistent throughout the entire document, making it especially useful for responsive design.
