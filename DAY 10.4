 CSS Nesting: The CSS nesting module defines a syntax for nesting selectors, providing the ability to nest one style rule inside another, with the selector of the child rule relative to the selector of the parent rule.  

 The writing-mode property specifies whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically.

 :is() Pseudo-Class (or :matches()):
The :is() pseudo-class allows you to select elements that match any of the provided selectors.
It's particularly useful when you want to apply the same styles to multiple selectors without repeating the styles. 

 :where() Pseudo-Class:
The :where() pseudo-class is similar to :is() and allows you to select elements that match any of the provided selectors.
It's typically used when you want to group selectors without applying specific styles. 

 :has() Pseudo-Class:
The :has() pseudo-class selects elements that contain a specific element or set of elements that match the provided selector.
It's currently not well-supported in modern browsers and may not be widely used in practice. 

 :not() Pseudo-Class:
The :not() pseudo-class allows you to select elements that do not match the provided selector.
It's commonly used to exclude specific elements from being styled.

 1: What the difference between :is() and :where()  
:where() has no specificity. 
:is() takes the specificity of its most specific selector. 

                                  Container Query
 Container queries enable you to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element's container. 
 container-type: The container-type CSS property is used to define the type of containment used in a container query. 
container-type: normal;
container-type: size;
container-type: inline-size; 

                                       clip-path 
The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. 
Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.
